  An experienced marketing consultant and sales professional who resides in
  Phoenix, Arizona, Chris Barney serves as a Senior Specialist for Advanced
  Client Solutions at the Tempe-based online reputation management and marketing
  firm ReputationDefender. In 2016, he joined the company as an Account Manager
  and oversaw between 400-500 marketing and reputation projects. Responsible for
  bringing in $660,000 annually in renewal bookings, he surpassed 100% quota in
  his first month straight out of training. 


  His accomplishments earned him a promotion to his current role, which focuses on client acquisition via inbound and outbound prospecting, project strategy and development, and establishing new markets. He has continued to build on these accomplishments since assuming this position. For instance, he cold-prospected and negotiated a 12-month, nearly $400,000 project, the largest cold-outbound prospect in the firm's history. In addition to his responsibilities at ReputationDefender, Chris co-founded HLTHY CBD in 2018 with one of his childhood best friends and serves as the marketing guy, product specialist, and heads up the customer experience. 


  Possessing nearly a decade of experience in the field of sales and marketing, Chris has a record of achievement. Prior to his role with ReputationDefender, he served as an Internet Sales Consultant at Gateway Chevrolet and ranked among the Western regionâ€™s top 10 percent in customer satisfaction. He also helped to grow an automobile startup business from 0 to 25 cosigned vehicles valued at over $2 million in less than 9 months as the Sales Manager exclusively via social media and the internet. Earlier in his career, he spent a year as an Outbound Sales Agent with an AT&T Enterprise program and was recognized as a top performer for the first and second quarters of 2014. Furthermore, he ranked highest in overall sales in five of his last sixth months at the firm.
